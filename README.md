# Vektonn playground

This repository contains various examples of Vektonn usage:

* [quick-start](quick-start) directory contains simple programs in different languages demonstrating Vektonn API usage
* In [jupyter-notebooks](jupyter-notebooks) directory you'll find examples of solving problems similar to real ones

## Quick Start

In order to run Vektonn locally you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Run Vektonn configured for QuickStart examples:
```bash
./docker/run-vektonn.sh QuickStart.Index
```

Look at [docker-compose.yaml](docker/docker-compose.yaml) to understand how to setup local Vektonn with single index shard.
